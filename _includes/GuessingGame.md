<!-- Problem start -->
{% include collapsible_start.html title="Problem" id="gg_0" %}

You are one of 10 people playing a game. There is a hidden number, from 1 to 100, that you want to guess. All 10 players submit their guess simultaneously, and the winning guess is the closest from either side (without wrapping around). You can expect the other players to guess completely randomly. What number should you guess?
